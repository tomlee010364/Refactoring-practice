Tank War
==================
Tank War is a simple game written in the summer of 2012, as an exercise of learning Java.

The current version is _v2.3.2_, and it may be the final version.
  
Build & Run
-----------
For Linux(Ubuntu) user, run following commands in your shell:
```sh

./rungame
```
For Windows user, please compile & run it by yourself because I'm lasy and have not written a script :P

If you want to write a script for the game such as `build.bat`, you are welcome to send me a pull request. ^ω^

By the way, I just tested the game in Windows and Ubuntu. It may have unknow problem running in other OS, and the font may be strange in other OS.
